Everything you need to build a digital garden, nothing you don't.

## Content

**Wiki Links** — Connect pages with `[[page-name]]` or `[[page-name|custom text]]`. Links resolve automatically, broken links get flagged during build.

**Backlinks** — Every page shows what links to it. No configuration needed.

**Tags** — Add `tags: [idea, project]` to frontmatter. Get tag pages automatically.

**Callouts** — Obsidian-compatible admonitions for notes, warnings, tips, and more.

> [!tip] Like this
> Use `> [!note]`, `> [!warning]`, `> [!tip]`, or `> [!danger]`

**Table of Contents** — Auto-generated from your headings. Toggle globally or per-page.

**Growth Stages** — Track note maturity with `growth: seedling`, `budding`, or `evergreen`.

## Discovery

**Full-Text Search** — Fast client-side search. Works offline, no external services.

**Graph View** — Visualize connections between your notes. Interactive, zoomable.

**Link Previews** — Hover over any wiki-link to preview the target page.

## Publishing

**One-Command Deploy** — `leafpress deploy` handles authentication, building, and pushing to GitHub Pages. No manual setup required.

**SEO Ready** — Automatic sitemap.xml, robots.txt, RSS feed, Open Graph tags, Twitter cards.

**Custom 404** — Styled error page, ready for any hosting platform.

**Fast Builds** — Hundreds of pages in milliseconds. Parallel processing, minimal allocations.

**Live Reload** — Changes appear instantly during development.

## Theming

**Typography** — Choose from Google Fonts for headings, body, and code.

**Colors** — Set your accent color. Light and dark backgrounds with gradient support.

**Dark Mode** — Built-in toggle with system preference detection.

**Navigation** — Sticky or pill-style nav. Box, underlined, or accent active states.

**Custom CSS** — Drop in a `style.css` to override anything.

## What's Not Included

leafpress is intentionally minimal. These are out of scope:

- **Comments** — Use Giscus, Utterances, or similar
- **Analytics** — Use Plausible, Fathom, or similar
- **CMS** — Edit markdown files directly
- **Image optimization** — Use a CDN or external tool for advanced needs (lazy loading is built-in)
- **Pagination** — Digital gardens are relational, not chronological
