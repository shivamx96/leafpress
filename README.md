# leafpress

A CLI-driven static site generator for digital gardens. Transform a folder of Markdown files into a clean, interlinked website with minimal configuration.

**Your garden folder IS the product. leafpress is invisible infrastructure.**

## Features

- **Wiki-style linking** - Use `[[Page Name]]` to link between notes
- **Backlinks** - Automatically track which pages link to each other
- **Growth stages** - Mark pages as seedling 🌱, budding 🌿, or evergreen 🌳
- **Tags & organization** - Auto-generated tag pages and section indexes
- **Live reload** - Development server with instant preview
- **Zero config** - Sensible defaults, customize only what you need
- **Graph export** - Visualize your knowledge graph with `graph.json`

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivamx96/leafpress.git
cd leafpress
go build -o leafpress ./cmd/leafpress
```

Add the binary to your PATH or move it to a location in your PATH:

```bash
sudo mv leafpress /usr/local/bin/
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a new garden

```bash
mkdir my-garden
cd my-garden
leafpress init
```

This creates:
- `leafpress.json` - Configuration file
- `index.md` - Your homepage
- `style.css` - Custom styles (optional)
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

### 2. Create your first note

```bash
leafpress new "notes/Hello World"
```

This creates `notes/hello-world.md` with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Hello World"
date: 2025-12-21
tags: []
draft: true
growth: "seedling"
---

Your content here...
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
leafpress serve --drafts
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your garden. The server rebuilds automatically when you edit files.

### 4. Build for production

```bash
leafpress build
```

Your static site is generated in `_site/` directory.

## Usage

### Commands

```bash
leafpress init              # Initialize a new site
leafpress new <path>        # Create a new page
leafpress build             # Build static site
leafpress build --drafts    # Include draft pages
leafpress serve             # Start dev server
leafpress serve --drafts    # Serve with drafts
leafpress serve --port 8080 # Use custom port
```

### Frontmatter

All pages support YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
date: 2025-12-21
tags: [programming, go]
draft: false
growth: "budding"  # seedling, budding, or evergreen
---
```

### Wiki Links

Link to other pages using wiki-style syntax:

```markdown
Check out [[My Other Note]] for more details.

You can also use [[Custom Text|notes/my-note]].
```

### Section Indexes

Create `_index.md` in any directory to customize its index page:

```markdown
---
title: "My Projects"
sort: "date"  # date, title, or growth
---

Here are my projects...
```

Without `_index.md`, leafpress auto-generates index pages.

## Configuration

Edit `leafpress.json` to customize your site:

```json
{
  "title": "My Digital Garden",
  "baseURL": "https://example.com",
  "outputDir": "_site",
  "port": 3000,
  "nav": [
    {"label": "Notes", "path": "/notes/"},
    {"label": "Projects", "path": "/projects/"}
  ],
  "theme": {
    "fontHeading": "Crimson Pro",
    "fontBody": "Inter",
    "fontMono": "JetBrains Mono",
    "accent": "#4a9eff",
    "stickyNav": true
  },
  "graph": true
}
```

### Theme Options

**Fonts**: Any Google Fonts family name (e.g., "Inter", "Space Grotesk", "Roboto")
- `fontHeading`: Font for headings and titles
- `fontBody`: Font for body text
- `fontMono`: Font for code blocks

**Accent**: Hex color for links and accents (e.g., "#4a9eff")

**Sticky Navigation**: Set `stickyNav` to `true` (default) to make the navigation bar stick to the top when scrolling

### Table of Contents

Enable an automatic table of contents that appears on the right side of pages (desktop only):

```json
{
  "toc": true
}
```

When enabled:
- Automatically extracts h2 and h3 headings from your content
- Displays as a sticky sidebar on wide screens (1280px+)
- Hidden on mobile and tablet for better reading experience
- Highlights the current section as you scroll
- Smooth scroll navigation to headings

### Custom Favicons

leafpress includes default favicons, but you can override them by placing your own in the root directory:

- `favicon.ico` - Classic ICO format (16x16 or 32x32)
- `favicon.svg` - Scalable vector format (recommended for modern browsers)
- `favicon-96x96.png` - High-resolution PNG (96x96 pixels)

Place any or all of these files in your garden's root directory, and they'll be used instead of the defaults.
