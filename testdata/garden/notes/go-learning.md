# Learning Go

My journey learning the Go programming language.

## Why Go?

- Simple syntax
- Fast compilation
- Great tooling
- Single binary deployment

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

## Projects

## Notes

Go's approach to error handling takes some getting used to. See [[systems-thinking]] for a mental model.
